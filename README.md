### TCSS 143 - Fundementals of Object Oriented Programming.
* Implement a low-complexity program (3 or more interacting classes) which includes the use of interfaces and/or abstract classes, and polymorphism given some design guidance.
* Apply object-oriented design concepts and techniques such as inheritance, composition, encapsulation, abstraction, method overloading, method overriding, exception handling, and scope appropriately to the implementation of a program.
* Provide formal documentation for a program, e.g.,Javadoc comments
* Use single and multidimensional arrays and basic abstract data types(Lists, Queues, Sets, Stacks) in the implementation of a program.
* Use a provided class, given only its API
* Apply recursive techniques to solve problems

### TCSS 305 - Programming Practicum
* Design, implement, document and debug a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes interfaces and/or abstract classes and a graphical user interface, given some guidance on the design.
* Design and implement unit tests for a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes interfaces and/or abstract classes.
* Utilize modern software engineering tools (e.g., IDEs, static checkers, unit testing frameworks, revision control systems) during the implementation of a medium complexity program.
* Correctly employ programming language features by reading and interpreting the associated published API documentation.

### TCSS 333 - C for System Programming.
* Distinguish various intermediate forms of a C program including preprocessor output, assembly
code, object code, and executable.
* Specify the memory layout of C's basic types, numeric, string, array, and structure.
* Allocate memory and use pointers to manipulate dynamic data structures and parameters.
* Use system routines to start, stop, and program communication between processes.
* Organize a complex program as a set of source and header files and use a tool such as make to
build it.

### TCSS 342 - Data Structures.
* Covers abstract data types, design and complexity analysis
of data, and usage of generic structure libraries in high-level programming languages.
Includes sequential and linked lists, heaps, binary search trees and balanced binary search
trees, B-trees, hash tables, and graphs.
* Apply knowledge of computing and mathematics appropriate to the discipline.
* Analyze a problem, identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its
solution.
* Design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or
program to meet desired needs.
* Apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in
the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates
comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.

### TCSS 343 - Algorthims.
* This class covered fundamental algorithms, such as sorting algorithms, basic graph algorithms (depth-first and breadth-first search, shortest path algorithms, minimum spanning tree algorithms), dynamic programming, and other kinds of algorithms.
