# C for System Programming.
Projects for TCSS 333

### Project 1 
* An interactive program that performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of binary numbers entered by the user.

### Project 2 - Image Manipulation
* This assignment requires you to manipulate and combine the data that is stored in two image files and create two new image files
* Creates a double explosure of the two input files or images.
* Creates an 8x8 checkerboard pattern of the two input files or images.

### Project 3 - Most Popular Names (Exercise in Pointers & Arrays)
* This assignment requires the use of files stored in “names.zip.”
* We will only concentrate on the 100 most popular female names in the years 1920, 1930, 1940, ..., 2010.
* Should read this data and create a single summary report file called "summary.csv". Each line of the summary file should contain a single name followed by its popularity rank in each of the 10 annual reports. The name and all the ranks (ranking of 1 as most popular to 100 as least popular) should be separated by commas.
* The names in the summary file must appear in alphabetical order. For any given name, the ranks should appear in chronological order (first the rank in 1920, then 1930, and so on until 2010).

### Project 4 - Image Manipulation without Arrays
* This assignment has you combine that knowledge with the use of pointers, pointer arithmetic, passing pointers to functions to use indirection (change the data) and double indirection (change the address to where the pointer points), memory allocation, and the free of previously allocated memory.
* This assignment requires you to manipulate and combine the data that is stored in two image files and create two new image files
* Creates a double explosure of the two input files or images.
* Creates an 8x8 checkerboard pattern of the two input files or images.

### Project 5 - Using an Array of Nested Struct(s)
* Will be using an array made of nested data structures each of which in c are known as struct.
* Read in a file.
* List the customers in order of the total value of their purchases, the largest total value customer appearing first. The items should be listed in order of the value of each item, the largest value item first.

### Project 6 - Using Linked Lists
* Make up a single linked list of words that appear in the input files.
* Sort the word list in decreasing order of the difference between the counts.

### Project 7 - Simulated Heap Using Linked Lists
* Implementation will be an "abstract object".
* Initially the private heap contains a single free block that has the same size as the call to create_pool. In responding to my_malloc and my_free calls, this initial block will sometimes be split into smaller pieces and these pieces must later be recombined (coalesce) whenever possible. At any given time, some of the blocks will be in use because my_malloc has given them to a caller, or they will be free, meaning they are (back) in the private heap. You must build a single linked list to keep track of all the blocks, whether they are free or not.

### Project 8 - Binary Representation of 32 bit Floating Point Values
* Program will read a series of lines from an input file A whole number, numerator, denominator.
* Example input: 3 3 4
* Example output: Floating point format of    3.750000000000000:
                                              0 10000000 11100000000000000000000
