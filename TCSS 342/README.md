### TCSS 143 - Fundementals of Object Oriented Programming.
* Implement a low-complexity program (3 or more interacting classes) which includes the use of interfaces and/or abstract classes, and polymorphism given some design guidance.
* Apply object-oriented design concepts and techniques such as inheritance, composition, encapsulation, abstraction, method overloading, method overriding, exception handling, and scope appropriately to the implementation of a program.
* Provide formal documentation for a program, e.g.,Javadoc comments
* Use single and multidimensional arrays and basic abstract data types(Lists, Queues, Sets, Stacks) in the implementation of a program.
* Use a provided class, given only its API
* Apply recursive techniques to solve problems

### TCSS 305 - Programming Practicum
* Design, implement, document and debug a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes interfaces and/or abstract classes and a graphical user interface, given some guidance on the design.
* Design and implement unit tests for a medium complexity program with an object hierarchy that includes interfaces and/or abstract classes.
* Utilize modern software engineering tools (e.g., IDEs, static checkers, unit testing frameworks, revision control systems) during the implementation of a medium complexity program.
* Correctly employ programming language features by reading and interpreting the associated published API documentation.
