Projects for TCSS 342

### Project 1 - Baron Burger
* The Burger Baron will make custom burgers from a text file.
* Constructs the burger using a custom stack as a linked structure.

### Project 2 - Evolved Names
* Evolutionary program that consists of letters A-Z while including -, , '
* Will simulate a strongest of a fit enviorment by mutating and calculating a fitness level of the string.
* Strings in this world can reproduce new strings and die if they are not fit enough. It will evolve strings in this world until they spell your name.

### Project 3 - Compressed Literature

* Compressing data based on character frequency in a message.
* Implemented custom priority queue.

### Project 4 - Compressed Literature (Implemented with own HashTable)
* Will take a large collection of raw text files of famous literature, including Leo Tolstoy’s War and Peace consisting of over 3 million characters, and store these works more efficiently using Huffman Encoding.
* Compress the data based on word frequency in a message.
* Implemented custom HashTable to store word frequency and binary codes.

### Project 5 - Maze Generator
* Generate a 2­dimensional n by m maze with no cycles using a graph.
* Generated maze by using Depth First Search graph traversal.
